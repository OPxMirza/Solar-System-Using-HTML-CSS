# Sun, Earth, and Moon Project

![Project Preview](Solar%20System/img.png)

This project is a visual representation of the Sun, Earth, and Moon using HTML and CSS. The Earth orbits around the Sun, and the Moon orbits around the Earth, showcasing a basic model of the solar system.

## Features

- **Sun, Earth, and Moon**: The Sun, Earth, and Moon are represented with simple shapes and sizes.
- **Orbital Animation**: The Earth revolves around the Sun, and the Moon revolves around the Earth with smooth animations.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is adaptable to different screen sizes.
- **Pure CSS Animations**: The animations are handled using CSS without JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the project.
- **CSS3**: For styling the elements and adding animations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OPxMirza/sun-earth-moon-animation.git

## How It Works

- The Sun, Earth, and Moon are represented as circles using `<div>` elements, styled using CSS.
- The orbits are simulated using CSS `@keyframes` to animate the Earth around the Sun and the Moon around the Earth.
